# Introduction:
1) In the given dataset, we need to predict satisfaction level of passenger. There are many features are available in dataset which are impacting the satisfaction level of passenger.
It is very compulsory to know what is your passenger expectation in airport.To conduct this analysis we are going to analyze this data deeply to derive some meaningful insights from the data.

2) As we know we have two classes in our target so we can named this problem as Binary Classification.

3) And another thing as we know our target label so we also can called it is supervised machine learning problem.

# Target Analysis:
1) It is very important to know before start analyze dataset that how is your target distributed among the classes. By doing this we can know that we are going to handle the balanced or imbalanced dataset.

2) As target is univariate and we are going to perform univariate analysis for this we can draw pie and cout chart to display our data.
